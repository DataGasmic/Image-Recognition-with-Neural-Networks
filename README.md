# Image-Recognition-with-Neural-Networks

This repository does and shall continue to consist of all my work and related experiences about Image Recognition,
Image Processing and Neural Networks with advancements in my knowledge and learning. 

I have tried to diversify the repository by significantly working with variety of projects that are standard and hold
great importance in the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Python has been used as the standard language for all these projects. Tensor Flow and Theano has been used wherever Deep Learning 
or Neural Networks come to Play! OpenCV, Keras and many other relevant libraries have been used.
